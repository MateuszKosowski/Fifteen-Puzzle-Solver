# Fifteen Puzzle Game
Development Team: Mateusz Kosowski, Nikodem Nowak

Our program searches for solutions to given initial states. It uses various algorithms such as: BFS, DFS, A* with Hamming and Manhattan heuristics. It is run concurrently. Then it is possible to generate graphs presenting a comparison of different methods
